# Stock-Price-Prediction
# üìà Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression  

This project demonstrates a **basic machine learning approach** to predict stock prices using historical data from **Yahoo Finance**. It applies **linear regression** on Apple (AAPL) stock data to forecast the next 30 days of closing prices.

## üöÄ Features  
- Fetches real stock data using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).  
- Prepares training and testing datasets with a **30-day prediction window**.  
- Implements a **Linear Regression** model using scikit-learn.  
- Visualizes **actual vs. predicted** stock prices.

  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
  ```
      1.Linear Regression is too simple: Stock prices are influenced by complex factors (news, market sentiment, global events) not captured here.
    
      2.Overfitting risk: The model only learns from historical data and may not generalize well.
      
      3.No external features: Uses only historical closing prices, ignoring trading volume, financial reports, or macroeconomic indicators.
      
      4.Short prediction horizon: Works only for 30-day ahead forecasting, but you can extend the training data window for potentially better accuracy.
      
      5.Not financial advice: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real trading decisions.
