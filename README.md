# Stock-Price-Prediction
A simple stock price prediction project using yfinance, scikit-learn, and linear regression. The code fetches Appleâ€™s stock data (AAPL), prepares features by shifting closing prices, trains a regression model, and forecasts the next 30 days. The results are visualized with Matplotlib, comparing actual vs. predicted prices.
